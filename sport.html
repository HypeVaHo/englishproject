        <h4><span>In a healthy body, a healthy mind and sports strengthen health. We have often heard these expressions
                and slogans since childhood in physical education classes. Nowadays it is fashionable to exercise, eat
                right and not have bad habits. For many people, sport is a great way to be alone with yourself and put
                your thoughts in order. Someone runs in the park with headphones in their ears, someone goes to a
                fitness club for training, and someone does physical education at home. How does sport strengthen human
                health and why do they need to be engaged? We have collected the main theses.</span></h4>
        <h2><span>The impact of sports on human health</span></h2>
        <h4><span>Toned body, cubes on the press, wasp waist. Who hasn't dreamed of such a figure? Endless promises to
                myself from the category of "I'll start on Monday" will not give the desired result. And debilitating
                starvation, as well as weight loss pills, will also cause damage to health. The secret of the dream body
                is simple – regular exercise and a balanced diet.</span></h4>
        <h4><span>Physical exercises not only provide a beautiful and fit figure, but also have a positive effect on
                overall health: they improve blood circulation, increase immunity, accelerate metabolism and help
                strengthen the muscle frame.</span></h4>
        <h4><span>Sport affects not only physical, but also mental health, having a beneficial effect on the nervous
                system. A person improves qualities such as dexterity, endurance and reaction speed.</span></h4>
        <h4><span>Not everyone is interested in visiting gyms alone. For such individuals there is a way out – team
                games (football, volleyball, basketball). With such physical activity, calories are burned, brain
                activity improves and mood rises. Combine business with pleasure!
            </span></h4>
        <h4><span>Some people have contraindications to sports. There is a way out for them – physical therapy. It is
                useful for chronic or congenital pathologies of the musculoskeletal system, as well as the digestive and
                respiratory systems. No one insists that it is necessary to break world records, but even regular
                walking at a fast pace contributes to the improvement of the body.</span></h4>
        <h2><span>How are sports and the nervous system connected?</span></h2>
        <h4><span>Physical activity also has a positive effect on the human central nervous system. When a person
                performs exercises, his blood circulation is activated and blood oxygen saturation increases. Sport
                helps strengthen the nervous system. This is important for neuromuscular coordination, which is
                responsible for the speed and accuracy of movement. The more difficult the exercises, the more intensely
                the brain is involved in the work. This, in turn, helps the body in the fight against aging. Summing up,
                we can safely state that the development of health and sports are important components of maintaining
                the safety of the human nervous system.</span></h4>
