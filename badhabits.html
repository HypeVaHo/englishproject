                                but also to the people around them and the whole society as a whole.</span></h4>
                <h2><span>Bad habits: SMOKING</span></h2>
                <h4><span>Smoking is one of the most common bad habits. Experts increasingly attribute this habit to
                                drug
                                addiction. Smokers inhale combustion products into the lungs and saturate the body with
                                a whole set of
                                toxic substances. Gorenje In addition, all these nasty things are inhaled by people
                                around the smoker
                                and very often they are also children. For them, this is also smoking, but
                                passive.</span></h4>
                <h2><span>Bad habits: ALCOHOLISM</span></h2>
                <h4><span>Alcoholism has long been out of the concept of a bad habit, alcoholism is a disease. With
                                alcoholism,
                                the work of not only the human body is disrupted, but also psychological processes
                                occur, leading to
                                irreversible degradation of the personality. Treatment of alcoholism requires the
                                participation of
                                doctors of various specializations, including psychologists.</span></h4>
                <h2><span>THE IMPACT OF BAD HABITS ON HUMAN HEALTH</span></h2>
                <h4><span>Very often, people suffering from bad habits do not know about the impact of these habits on
                                health or
                                do not realize the danger that alcohol and tobacco pose. And it is not uncommon when a
                                person, simply
                                realizing what harm he does to himself and others, breaks up with bad habits.</span>

                <h2><span>The impact of smoking on human health:</span></h2>
                <h4><span>The structure of nails and hair deteriorates, the skin color changes.
                                Teeth turn yellow and weaken, bad breath appears.
                                The vessels of the smoker become brittle and inelastic.
                                Tobacco smoking contributes to the putrefaction of the gastrointestinal tract.
                                The risk of stomach ulcers increases.
                                Oxygen metabolism in the body is disrupted and, as a result, blood purification becomes
                                difficult.
                                Nicotine increases blood pressure.

                                system increases.
                                The protection of the respiratory tract is violated, as a result of which smokers are
                                more susceptible
                                to diseases of the throat, bronchi and lungs, as well as more difficult to tolerate
                                these diseases.
                                Smoking contributes to the development of cancer.
                                Smoking of pregnant women has a very negative effect on the health of the child. Very

                                children lag behind in development and get sick more often.</span></h4>
                <h2><span>The effect of alcohol on human health.</span></h2>
                <h4><span>In Russia, about 700 thousand people die from alcohol every year. This is the population of

                                regardless of gender, age, education and financial status. Women and minors are most at
                                risk of alcohol
                                dependence.</span></h4>
                <h4><span>The body's immune system is destroyed.
                                The activity of the liver, which carries the main cleansing function in the body, is
                                disrupted.
                                The digestive system is disrupted, which leads to severe diseases of the esophagus,
                                stomach, and
                                pancreas.
                                The regulation of blood sugar levels is disrupted.
                                Alcohol inevitably leads to diseases of the cardiovascular system, because alcohol
                                destroys red blood
                                cells (blood cells), which cease to perform their functions correctly.
                                Alcohol consumption during pregnancy leads to severe consequences for the child, as well
                                as adversely
                                affects all future generations.
                                Alcohol shortens a person's life by 10-15 years
                                Alcohol disrupts the nervous system and leads to loss of memory and attention, problems

                                development, thinking, psyche and very often to complete degradation of personality.
                                The main "blow" of alcoholic beverages falls on the brain. Alcohol leads to the
                                destruction of the
                                cerebral cortex and the death of entire sections of it.</span></h4>
