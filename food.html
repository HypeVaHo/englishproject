            <h4><span>Basic facts:
                </span></h4>
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h4><span>A healthy diet provides protection from malnutrition in all its forms, as well as from
                    non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.
                    Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are the main health risks worldwide.
                </span></h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4><span>The practice of healthy eating is formed in the early stages of life ― breastfeeding promotes
                    healthy growth and improves cognitive development and can have a beneficial effect on health in
                    the
                    long term, for example, reduces the likelihood of overweight or obesity and the development of
                    NCDs
                    later in life.</span></h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4><span>Energy consumption (calories) should be balanced with its consumption. In order to avoid
                    unhealthy
                    weight gain, the total fat intake should not exceed 30% of the total energy consumed. Saturated
                    fats
                    should be less than 10%, and trans fats – less than 1% of the total energy consumed, and when
                    consuming fats, it is necessary to replace saturated fats and trans fats with unsaturated fats
                    and
                    strive to exclude trans fats from the diet of industrial production.</span></h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4><span>Reducing the consumption of free sugars to less than 10% of the total energy consumed is part
                    of a
                    healthy diet, and reducing their consumption to less than 5% presumably provides additional
                    health
                    benefits.</span></h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4><span>Salt intake of less than 5 g per day (equivalent to sodium intake of less than 2 g per day)
                    promotes the prevention of hypertension and reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke among
                    the
                    adult population.</span></h4>

            <h4><span>
                    WHO member States have put forward a goal to reduce global salt consumption by 30% by 2025, as
                    well
                    as to stop the increase in the number of cases of diabetes and obesity in adults and adolescents
                    and
                    overweight in children by 2025.</span></h4>

        <hr>
        <h4><span>A healthy diet throughout life contributes to the prevention of malnutrition in all its forms, as
                well
                as a number of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and health disorders. At the same time, the growth
                of
                processed food production, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in
                nutrition
                patterns. Nowadays, people consume more foods high in calories, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium,
                and
                many people don't consume enough fruits, vegetables and other types of fiber, such as whole
                grains.</span></h4>
        <hr>
        <h4><span>The exact composition of a varied, balanced and healthy diet depends on individual characteristics
                (such as age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, available local
                products and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of a healthy diet remain the
                same.</span>
