        <h4><span>The formation of a lifestyle that promotes human health is carried out at three levels:

                social: propaganda, information and educational work;
                infrastructural: specific conditions in the main spheres of human activity (availability of free time,
                material resources), preventive institutions, environmental control;
                personal: the system of human value orientations, standardization of everyday life.
                The promotion of a healthy lifestyle is understood as a number of activities aimed at its
                popularization,
                among which the most important are educational and field programs, advertising in the media (radio,
                television, Internet).</span></h4>
        <hr>
        <h4><span>At the end of the XIV century, the medieval medical treatise "Tacuinum sanitatis" in Latin told about
                a
                healthy lifestyle. The prototype of this book could be the work of the Baghdad scientist and doctor Ibn
                Butlan "Maintaining health". Much more attention than medicinal herbs is paid in the book to the
                description
                of the beneficial and harmful properties of certain types of food and edible plants, and six conditions
                for
                maintaining health are also given.</span></h4>
        <hr>
        <h4><span>In the psychological and pedagogical direction, a healthy lifestyle is considered from the point of
                view of
                consciousness, human psyche, motivation. There are other points of view (for example, biomedical), but
                there
                is no sharp line between them, since they are aimed at solving one problem — strengthening the health of
                the
                individual.</span>
        </h4>

        <h4><span>A healthy lifestyle is a prerequisite for the development of various aspects of human life, the
                achievement
                of active longevity and the full performance of social functions, for active participation in labor,
                social,
                family, household, leisure activities. A healthy lifestyle appears as a specific form of expedient human
                activity — an activity aimed at preserving, strengthening and improving his health.</span>
